      <p>
        Elon Reeve Musk is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder,
        CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product
        architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of the
        Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the
        philanthropic Musk Foundation. With an estimated net worth of around
        $192 billion as of March 27, 2023, primarily from his ownership stakes
        in Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the second-wealthiest person in the world,
        according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's
        real-time billionaires list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended at the
        University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 18, acquiring
        citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he
        matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of
        Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
        physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University.
        After two days, he dropped out and with his brother Kimbal, co-founded
        the online city guide software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired
        by Compaq for $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank.
        X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal, which eBay acquired
        for $1.5 billion in 2002.
      </p>

      <p>
        With $175.8 million, Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a spaceflight services
        company. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle
        manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its
        chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In
        2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later
        acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded
        OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The
        following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology company
        developing brain–computer interfaces—and the Boring Company, a tunnel
        construction company. Musk has also proposed a hyperloop high-speed
        vactrain transportation system. In 2022, his acquisition of Twitter for
        $44 billion was completed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Musk has made controversial statements on politics and technology,
        particularly on Twitter, and is a polarizing figure. He has been
        criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including
        spreading COVID-19 misinformation. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and
        Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had
        secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. Musk stepped down as
        chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of a settlement
        agreement with the SEC.
